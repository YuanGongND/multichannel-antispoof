# Detecting Replay Attacks Using Multi-Channel Audio: A Neural Network-Based Method

With the rapidly growing number of security sensitive systems that use voice as the primary input, it becomes increasingly important to address these systemsâ€™ potential vulnerability to replay attacks. Previous efforts to address this concern have focused primarily on single-channel audio. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network-based replay attack detection model that further leverages spatial information of multi-channel audio and is able to significantly improve the replay attack detection performance.

## Updates
June, 30, 2020:
- New uploads, might contain bugs

## Dataset
**ReMASC Corpus** (92.3GB)

Data we used in the paper. Please download it from **\[[IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/remasc-realistic-replay-attack-corpus-voice-controlled-systems)]**,  it is free. You will need an [IEEE account](https://ieee-dataport.org/faq/how-do-i-access-dataset-ieee-dataport) to download, which is also free.

The complete set consists of two disjoint set:

- **Core Set**: the suggest training and development set.
- **Evaluation Set**: the suggest evaluation set. 

We also include an unsplited complete set in the .zip package in case you want to customerize the data split. It is just a simple union of the core set and the evaluation set.
